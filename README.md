TS3Gifbox
================

Rotates the GFX banner of a Teamspeak server at a set interval.
Downloads, converts and adds to the rotation the URIs of the videos he receives by private message.

WARNING
=================

Usage reveals that TeamSpeak 3 has a tendancy to re-download GIFs instead of caching them, causing bandwith consumption issues (e.g. 100 Gio during a single weekend) on data capped connections.
